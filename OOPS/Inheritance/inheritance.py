The process of inheriting the properties of the parent class into a child class is called inheritance. 
The existing class is called a base class or parent class and 
the new class is called a subclass or child class or derived class
--Advanges
 There are three main advantages of inheritance:
•	Common properties can be kept in a single class, thus any changes need to be made need not be repeated
•	Inheritance encourages code reuse thus saving us time

  **To create an inheritance relationship between the classes, mention the name of the parent class in brackets
